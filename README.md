Final project code is contained in the jupyter notebook. 

The data is housed in the sim3 folder, this is the Monte Carlo generated data from PNNL... this data was too large to put into Git directly. 

This project was started by Sam Angus in 2023 and I inherited the base for the code and the data from him
